# Banner
banner command written in C
For a litle boasting :P I wrote this in Java when I was in class 11. Then rewrote it in C in first year of college.

Steps:
1.)Compile
gcc banner.c -o banner.o

2.)Run
./banner.o Hello I am Maddy

Sample output is attached as image banner_output_preview.png

Have fun!
