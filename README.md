# Banner
banner command written in C
For a litle boasting :P I wrote this in Java when I was in class 11. Then rewrote it in C in first year of college.

Steps:
1.)Compile
gcc banner.c -o banner.o

2.)Run
./banner.o Hello I am Maddy

Sample output is attached as image banner_output_preview.png


Extra: You can change font size by modifying variable n in banner.c . Default is n=12 lines.

However, not all values of n give properly formatted output.


Have fun!
