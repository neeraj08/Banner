# Banner
banner command written in C.

For a little boasting :P I wrote this in Java when I was in class 11. Then rewrote it in C in first year of college.

Steps:

1.)Compile

gcc banner.c -o banner.o

2.)Run

./banner.o Hello I am Maddy


Extra: You can change font size by modifying variable n in banner.c . Default is n=12 lines.

Have fun!
